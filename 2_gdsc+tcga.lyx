Gene set methods for drug response

\begin_layout Standard
Pathway methods have been used for a while in a cancer context, both for
 cell lines an primary tumours.
 Most of the time, the method of choice is to take a gene set from either

, and calculate a combined expression score using either a Fisher's exact
 test (e.g.

 There are, however, more advanced pathway methods available.

s.
 I will leave the more complex methods for a later chapter and focus on
 GSEA using different gene sets here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GSEA using GO gene sets is ubiquitous: usually, a (for instance) differential
 expression analysis yields a list of genes, yet it is not clear which higher-le
vel function they mediate.
 After computing the enrichment scores, our list of genes is condensed down
 to a list of significantly enriched GO categories, that may be related
 to the phenotype we are observing.
 This may work very well in some cases.
 There are, however, a couple of caveats to observe: (1) a gene does not
 exclusively belong to one process; we might very well get a significant
 p-value only caused by the overlap between different sets, (2) if we test
 all categories and correct by false discovery rate we might dilute our
 signal so much that small categories can no longer be significant, or (3)
 the process that did indeed cause our phenotype does not correspond to
 a gene set at all (this can be due to missing biological knowledge, annotation
 errors, or simply the fact that curators have not yet added a certain gene
 to a certain category).
 Maybe the most dangerous caveat of them all is that once we see our list
 of resulting categories, we are inclined to pick out category that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

makes sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Taken this selection of desired categories on its head, we may also be
 inclined to overlook a category that we don't want to see, e.g.
 because the involved process is already known in literature and we could
 not publish our new findings in a high-impact journal.
 The aim of this chapter is to illustrate these issues.

Calculation of the running sum statistic for GSEA and GSVA

\end_inset

Calculation of the running sum statistic for GSEA and GSVACalculation of
 the running sum statistic (top left) and absolute deviation for enrichment
 score in case of GSEA vs.
 the difference in GSVA.
 Genes are ordered, genes that are in the query set are indicated by black
 bars.
 The red line indicates the running sum score where a score is added each
 time there is a hit and subtracted otherwise.
 GSEA hence produces a bimodal distribution of scores (left), while GSVA
 produces a unimodal distribution (right).
 This is why the former needs label shuffling of two conditions (bottom
 left) to compute empirical p-values, while the latter produces scores for
 each sample (but no statistical significance; bottom right).

 is the 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 standard to compute the expression level of a set of genes.
 It uses as an input a ranked list of genes (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
latin{e.g.}

\end_inset

 fold changes).
 It them computes the running sum of a set of interest by starting at the
 beginning of this list and adding a score if the current gene is in the
 set, or subtracts a score otherwise.
 This can be summarised like the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{g+1}=s_{g}+\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
1/n_{set}\\
-1/(n-n_{set})
\end{array}\right.\begin{array}{c}
g\in set\\
g\notin set
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A schema of this calculation is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GSEA_schema"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of GSEA, the overall score is the maximal deviation from zero.
 As is shown in the example, this leads to a bimodal distribution of scores
 when testing different sets or the same set on different samples, because
 even if the genes in the set of interest are evenly spread, there will
 always be a deviation.
 As GSEA is commonly used to compute the significance of enrichment between
 two conditions (left panels in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GSEA_schema"

\end_inset

), this is not a problem: we can obtain the distribution of scores under
 the null hypothesis by shuffling the labels of the reference and the samples
 we are looking at, and then compute the empirical p-value as quantile of
 this distribution.
 This, however, also means that we need to compare two conditions in order
 to do this reliably.
 We can not compute enrichment scores for each individual sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gene Set Variation Analysis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 solves this: instead of taking the maximal deviation, it takes the difference
 between maximum positive and negative enrichment score.
 This directly yields a unimodal distribution of enrichment scores in different
 samples that can hence be used in statistical tests that assume normality

The original GDSC data set contained different dilutions of drugs that the
 cell lines in the panel were subjected, measuring how much it interfered
 with their growth.
 Since I have got a pathway score for each cell line, I also need a single
 value corresponding to the sensitivity to a given drug.
 One way to do this is to measure the growth inhibition at different concentrati
ons, and then fit a dose-response curve to the data points, interpolating
 (or extrapolating, if necessary) the concentration at which the half-maximal
 inhibition occurred.
 This term is referred to the

 Among the the top drugs, there are MEK inhibitors (Trametinib, RDEA119),
 p53-stabiliser Nutlin-3a, and the multi-kinase inhibitor WZ3105.
 The biological processes that they are involved in have no obvious connection

)).
 The MEK inhibitors Trametinib and RDEA119 associate most strongly with
 fibrin clot dissolution and laminin interactions (a fibrous protein present
 in the basal lamina of the epithelia).
 Gemcitabine and Etoposide are more effective if Influenza-related pathways
 are expressed, possibly hinting at involvement of the DNA replication machinery
 in promoting sensitivity to a Topoisomerase inhibitor and nucleoside analogue,
 respectively.
 Resistance to WZ3105 is again associated with a process acting on the drug,
 but this time it is export rather than modification.

The original SPEED platform

\end_inset

 consists of signatures of 11 pathways, derived and comprised of the genes
 responsive to a total of 215 experiments (the perturbations between a control
 and a perturbed condition).
 They use a consensus gene signature across multiple experiments, perturbing
 agents, and other conditions to arrive at a gene list that corresponds
 to pathway activation in a wide condition.
 These consensus signatures of pathway perturbations are distinct from the
 expression level of pathway members, as described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

The authors of the original SPEED publication used four parameters to generate
 gene lists from their input experiments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Z-score cutoff: the top n% of upregulated genes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Total expression cutoff: the top m% of genes considering their basal expression
 in each experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 conditions must be met

 and Python query tools the authors provided, I extracted gene lists with
 the given cutoff.
 First, I used the default parameters in their implementation, which was
 to include all genes that were top 5% of up-regulated genes by z-score,
 overall top 50% of expressed genes, in at least 20% of the experiments
 per pathway, and disregarding whether the gene was in any other pathway
 or not.
 Using these default parameters, I obtained scores that were highly correlated
 between the different pathways, as shown in figure

To counteract this problem, I extracted gene lists for different combinations
 of those four parameters and Python query tools the authors provided:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Z-score: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5,

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each combination, I performed a scan of the four adjustable platform
 parameters to optimize the order obtained by GSEA scores between control
 and stimulated experiments.
 For combination of parameters, 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

latin{i.e.}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for each of the 4950 gene lists, I calculated the raw enrichment score
 for each pathway and cell line, yielding a total of 55 million enrichment
 scores.
 I then went on to, for each pathway, construct a precision-recall curve
 that quantified how well the GSEA scores were able assign lower pathway
 activation scores to the control arrays than the perturbed arrays (where,
 in the case of an inhibition I performed GSEA using negative z-scores).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of control arrays comprised all the un-stimulated arrays in the
 database, and the stimulated set all arrays in the database where a certain
 pathway was perturbed.
 I used as a measure of performance the area under the precision-recall
 curve.
 A perfect ordering (that is, all control arrays and then all stimulated
 arrays) corresponded to a precision-recall AUC (prAUC) of 1, while a random
 ordering would respond to a prAUC about 0.5.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using not only the matched control arrays to the perturbed arrays but
 all arrays present in the data set, we allow cross-activation of pathways
 while minimizing the fit to random differences in gene expression by different
 initial conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I split the data set (both control and perturbed arrays) in five different
 subsets, where four of the five were the designated training set and the
 fifth the designed test set.
 I calculated the prAUC for all the parameters described in the previous
 section, and chose the set with the highest score.
 I then went on to the part that was not used in training and quantified
 the prAUC there as well.
 I performed the whole process five times, with another subset functioning
 as the test set each time.
 I then chose the set that the highest prAUC.
 I did not simply select the highest highest AUC in the test set because
 I would not want to select a model that performed badly on the training
 set to begin with.

 the pathway scores (figure

 The values for the different gene list cutoff parameters that I selected

Associations between Pathway Scores and Tissues

As a control, I compared the inferred pathway activation scores between

 Relating this to known biology, the scores seem well supported by previously

Pan-Cancer Drug Associations

\begin_layout Standard
I calculated a linear regression between the obtained pathway scores and

s for all cell lines and each pathway while correcting for tissues (used
 as covariate).
 I adjusted p-values by controlling the false discovery rate and visualized
 the result as volcano plots and individual fits.
 For separate fits between tissues, I only calculated associations that
 had at least two sensitive cell lines (defined as it being in the top 10%
 of responders, not 100x less sensitive than the most sensitive overall,
 and having an IC50 below 1 uM).

 are more likely to be affected by this.

The importance of mutations, especially when they are drivers, and their
 role in a cell line's response to the different drugs is well established.
 With the new GDSC release

 the authors uncovered previously unknown links that may ultimately lead
 to new clinical indications, or prioritise the development of certain drugs
 over others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to this, the biological meaning of the top associations between
 gene set or pathway scores and drug response I obtained is doubtful at
 best.
 What does it mean to have an association of the

We thus have two options: we either need to link seemingly unrelated gene
 sets back to the process that actually caused a difference in drug response,
 or we need to pre-select gene sets that may be relevant for drug response.
 Needless to say, the first approach may in most cases prove impossible,
 as we can not easily follow the chain of causality between a biological
 process that mediates differential drug response and its downstream readout
 as change of gene expression.
 The second alternative does not solve this, but leads to a much higher
 probability to catch causative gene sets when we already select candidates
 of exactly this by prior knowledge.

\begin_layout Subsection
Pathway-responsive genes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using pathway-responsive genes instead of pathway expression to infer signalling
 activity makes a lot of sense: we look at the footprint of the actual signallin
g activity (the expression changes downstream of a signaling pathway) and
 not the potential mediators (protein kinases, among others) by mRNA expression
 level that is a lot further removed from the actual signalling going on
 in a cell.
 However, the SPEED platform has some issues in terms of the level in which
 its pathways are correlated to one another: If we did calculate drug associatio
ns with the original scores, hits would be groups where a given drug is
 correlated with all pathways in about the same extent.
 This is likely due to how they only evaluated gene lists by their overlap
 with Gene Ontology categories, and not how well its enrichment scores are
 able to differentiate between microarrays where a given pathway perturbation
 is present and those where it is absent.
 And it is not useful for our purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus have a need for scores that are more potent in distinguishing the
 gene expression footprints from one pathway to another.
 A way to do this in the existing platform is to no longer require that
 the signature genes from all pathways are obtained using the same cutoffs
 of the author's 4 parameters, but instead optimise them in way so that
 they are best able to tell apart the pathways one from another.
 Looking at the correlations between the original cutoffs and the ones I
 suggest after the cross-validated optimisation, I know that this worked
 at least on those terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next question to answer is whether we get more meaningful drug associations.
 Looking at the volcano plot for both pan-cancer and individual tissues,
 associations are, for one, not between a drug and all pathways, and for
 the other much better supported when searching for literature corresponding
 to the top hits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is still a number of potential issues with the current model,
 many of which can be traced back to using the original platform: (1) The
 authors use raw microarray data as well as processed data.
 For the processed data, we have no idea of what the original authors did
 with their data to arrive at the expression levels they report.
 Sometimes they report this in their respective experimental or data analysis
 procedures, but often they don't.
 There is a potential of all sorts of biases that we can not control for.
 (2) The platform as it currently stands needs four parameters to be specified,
 each of which corresponds to a somewhat arbitrary cutoff.
 Even if we ignore this, they limit that method in a way that does not support
 down-regulated genes at all (as the z-scores are filtered by top percentile
 only).
 (3) We bias the selection of genes to the ones most commonly found in microarra
ys.
 If a gene is highly upregulated but not present in arrays and thus failing
 the overlap cutoff, we would lose it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence I argue that, while the optimisation of parameters yielded vast improvemen
ts in terms of correlatedness of scores and resulting drug associations,
 it still has enough drawbacks to suggest that a different approach keeping
 the overall idea of using pathway-responsive genes as signature for pathway
 activity may be worth exploring.
 I describe this in chapter 3.
