\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis would not have been possible without the generous support and
feedback of many people, for which I am deeply grateful.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Julio Saez-Rodriguez
for providing me with the opportunity to undertake my PhD in his group at
EMBL-EBI as well as his support during my PhD. I would also like to extend my
gratitude to all members of the Saez Rodriguez group, especially Francesco
Iorio, Emanuel Goncalves, Luz Garcia Alonso, Michael Menden and Camille Terfve
for fruitful dicussions and their friendship.

I would like to thank my academic collaborators, among which are my industry
supervisor Joanna Betts, the possibility to visit the US site of GSK with
Pankaj Agarwal, the Sanger GDSC team lead by Mathew Garnett and Ultan
McDermott, as well as people involved in smaller side projects too numerous to
name.

Many thanks to my TAC members Florian Markowetz, Sarah Teichmann, and Christoph
Merten who I was always looking forward to meet once a year for a useful
critique of my project and much needed direction.

Finally, I would like to thank the EMBL community for an amazing four years
that I spent at the institute. You know who you are.
