Causes of genetic variation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Germline variation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the human population, there is natural variation in the genome from one
 individual to another, which gets passed down through generations in the
 process of reproduction.
 Each human being has two copies of their DNA, one passed down from their
 mother and the other passed down from their father.

\end_inset

 Disregarding of where the copies that an individual actually inherits came
 from, they may harbour the same sequence (that is, the individual is homozygous
 in a given base or gene) or may be different between those so-called alleles
 (that is, the individual is heterozygous).
 This together with our environment is what makes us look different, but
 also what may cause us to be more or less susceptible to a certain disease
 or treatment thereof.
 Since the genes were assembled in the fertilized egg already that afterwards
 underwent cell divisions (in a process called mitosis), all the cells in
 our body in theory harbour the same DNA sequence, with the exception that
 sex cells only contain one copy that was assembled in a cut-and-paste process
 (called meiosis) of the two somatic ones

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Somatic variation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should we sequence each cell in an individual, we would not find that all
 of their consecutive bases made up of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs are indeed identical,
 but there is also variation within each individual.
 There may be a change that is common to cells that derive from the same
 parental cell, or a change may have been introduced in a single cell by
 an internal or external process.
 In the former case, we need to realize that the DNA copy mechanism (also
 called DNA replication) that ensures that when a cell splits both its daughter
 cells inherit two full copies of its DNA is not infinitely accurate.
 Rather, this process may introduce reading- (from the ancestral or template
 strand) and writing (the newly synthesised strand) errors.
 In fact, in each cell division there is an average of 100 errors that are
 introduced while copying the each of the three billion bases (times the
 two alleles) that is our genome 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kunkel2000-ts,McCulloch2008-wm"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an error may manifest itself in multiple ways.
 The replication apparatus (DNA polymerase) may miss the insertion of a
 base or a couple of bases that was in the ancestral in the newly synthesised
 strand, which produces a small deletion, or insert a base that was not
 in the original strand, thereby producing an insertion.
 It may also insert the wrong base, which leads to a substitution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Loeb1974-hz"

\end_inset

.
 While discussing these mutational processes one should keep in mind that
 those errors introduced do manifest itself only on one of the two strands
 in an allele, which will lead to a base no longer matching its opposite
 pair as well as if there had been no error.

Mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variation

Functional impact of mutations: the central dogma
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gene that has an erroneous sequence somewhere on the DNA is, by itself,
 not a cause for a cell to alter its function.
 Instead, genes only store the information, like having a template, that
 is required to form an active compound from it.
 Genes can be transcribed in regulatory RNA, or messenger RNA (mRNA; both
 derived from DNA by a process called transcription) that is later used
 by the Ribosome to chain amino acids together to a functional protein in
 a process called translation.
 The process of transcription and translation is referred to the central
 dogma of molecular biology

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path from mRNA to protein may involve additional steps, such as cutting
 out unneeded parts or pasting together different building blocks (splicing),
 or covalently attaching sugars or other chemical groups (post-translational
 modifications) to yield the functional protein and/or to regulate its activity

 Proteins are involved in the transduction of a signal from a molecular
 cue binding to a receptor on a cell's surface is how a cell responds to
 changes in its environment.
 In turn, this signal is relayed through the network of kinases and phosphatases

\begin_layout Plain Layout
there are other chemical modifications, but those are the best studied
\end_layout

\end_inset

 until it reaches the terminal nodes that are the transcription factors,
 acting in conjunction with polymerase III and other co-factors to initiate
 changes in gene expression.
 Those genes are in turn transcribed into RNA, and if they are protein-coding
 consequently translated into those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take, for instance, a protein involved in relaying a signal from the cell
 surface, such as a signal to grow and divide, to another protein that in
 turn activates some other proteins which ultimately induces the expression
 of genes that are needed for the cell's replication machinery.
 These signals are usually relayed by post-translational modifications (
\begin_inset ERT

) from one protein to another.
 One of the best-studied processes is phosphorylation (the addition of a
 phosphate group - proteins that do that are called kinases, the ones that
 remove phosphatases) of Serines or Threonines.
 These are amino acids with an OH group in their side chain and are thus
 susceptible to it

 This protein now may be affected by a mutation so that it no longer waits
 for an upstream signal to transduce, but sends the downstream signal to
 grow and divide irrespective of what the upstream input is.

Genes that are relevant for cancer development and progression have long
 been classified in Oncogenes and Tumour Suppressor Genes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Croce2008-bn"

\end_inset

.
 In broad terms, this classification represents the following: does a mutation
 introduce a gene function that was not there before, or it loses sensitivity
 to an inhibitory signal that kept it in check, this gene is called an Oncogene
 in its active (mutated) form, or Proto-Oncogene in its wild-type form;
 conversely, if a mutation causes a gene to lose its function as e.g.
 a negative regulator of cell growth, it is called a Tumour Suppressor Gene.
 The first Tumour Suppressor Gene that has been found was

 More recently, mutations that actively contribute to either development
 of progression of a cancer have been called drivers, while the mutations
 introduced by e.g.
 a faulty DNA replication machinery (that a cancer may have caused) that
 bear no functional impact on the cell are called passenger mutations.
 Driver genes are usually either activated Oncogenes or Tumour suppressor
 genes, but may also have both functions

 However, most cells do not start to divide uncontrollably, even if they

However, there are a couple of challenges when trying to assess the whole
 genetic diversity of a sample.
 It is important to take it not only in one place, but either homogenise
 the tissue or selectively take small samples in different subsections.
 Another challenge is that for detecting very minor frequencies, one needs
 to read the genome many times over and be sure that the resulting variants
 are not only due to errors in this process, or any other by which the sample
 is treated after acquisition.

Therapeutic interventions

\begin_layout Subsection
The therapeutic window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within a therapeutic intervention, our goal is to selectively treat (or
 kill) the diseased cells while not impacting the normal function of other
 cells in the body.
 If at first we assume that a treatment can be delivered to all cells of
 the body in the same amount, the question is whether the impact it has
 is impacting the cells we want to act on more than all the other cells
 we want to impact as little as possible.
 If we take the simple example of killing cells, we want a drug that kills
 all the bad cells and leaves the good cells alone.
 Hence, an effective drug will work on the bad cells at a lower concentration
 than on the good ones.
 If the concentration is too high, it will undoubtedly affect other cells
 as well.
 This range of concentration, where a given drug already acts on the target
 cells but does not confer toxicity to other cells is called the therapeutic
 window.
 The broader it is, the easier it is to work with this drug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaborating on our simplification, it is of course not the case that an
 administered compound will be available to all cells at the same concentration.

, it first needs to reach the bloodstream (which includes uptake and resorption,
 then modification in the liver and pancreas if taken orally), then be distribut
ed by the flow of blood into all the capillaries (which the exception of
 the brain that has an additional barrier), until finally cells are able
 to absorb it.
 As a rule of thumb whether a drug can be orally absorbed or not, a common
 measure is

Cytotoxic drugs

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way to kill cancer cells is to expose them to a compound that
 is generally toxic to cells.
 While this is expected to have a negative impact on all cells, there are
 certain properties of cancer cells that make them more susceptible.
 One such property is that they grow more actively than most other cells,
 and so a therapeutic window exists for compounds that interfere with cell
 growth, as is the case for most chemotherapy.
 This could be DNA synthesis (Cisplatin or Carboplatin), microtubule disassembly
 (Paclitaxel and more generally Taxol-based compounds), or others

A recurrent theme of cancer development and progression is the aberrant
 activation of specific molecular cues in cell signalling.
 An example of this is the well-known

 But there are many more instances where a mutation in a gene yields a gene
 product that is abnormally active- or inactive.
 This often includes members of the MAP kinase pathway (like EGFR, RAS,
 RAF, MEK, or ERK), but frequently also other proteins and pathways that
 confer a selective advantage in a given context.
 An important aspect in that regard is the concept of oncogene addiction:
 Once a cell, or a population of cells, suffers a molecular lesion that
 causes aberrant signalling, the cell (or cells) become dependent on exactly
 that signal.
 Turn it off, and those cells are likely to die

This has an important implication for cancer therapy: if we are able to
 find (or design) a compound that specifically turns off one of those abnormally
 active proteins, we can kill cells that have it active.

 mutation, computational chemists indeed designed and developed a small-molecule
 inhibitor called Plexicon (more specifically, PLX4720 or nowadays called
 Vemurafenib) that proved to bind the mutated version of the BRAF protein
 with a much higher affinity than the one found in wild-type cells.
 This, in some ways, could be considered the perfect drug for cancer therapy,
 because it has it has favourable uptake in the body and afterwards the
 therapeutic window is much larger compared to other compounds due to this
 difference in binding affinity

Development of resistance

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, targeted therapies often can not kill all cells before they
 acquire a resistance mechanism to the treatment, or a sub-population of
 cells were resistant to begin with and then outgrow their competitors.
 This is one of the reasons why targeting mutations in driver genes is a
 good start, but it needs to be augmented with knowledge of the dynamic
 changes mutations induce in the cellular signalling network and the evolutionar
y paths for a cell to respond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us revisit one of the most well-known examples in targeted therapies,
 the inhibition of

 mutants.
 This example of targeted therapy works with the intended effect in such
 that it kills cancer cells to an extent that makes multiple from the outside
 clearly visible tumours completely disappear for months 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which could be hailed as a success for identifying a target and rationally
 designing an inhibitor that abrogates oncogenic signalling.
 However, there was one drawback: after a couple more weeks past the initial
 success the tumour cells were able to overcome the effects of the inhibitor,
 leading to the recurrence of tumours that the patient later died from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, together with multiple other examples, proved to show that targeted
 therapies work for a while, but they are, in a lot of cases, unable to
 permanently suppress tumour growth.
 But how does this work? In order for a tumour to regrow, there need to
 be some cancerous cells left alive after treatment, as this rapid regrowth
 of mass can not be explained by an independent inception.
 Hence, some cells must have survived the process of therapy

Disease models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to argue that in order to find better cancer treatments, we first
 need to understand better the molecular mechanisms that drive it.
 This is especially true because the mechanisms involved from the inception
 of cancer up the its progression and spreading are in fact molecular mechanisms
 that have spun out of the normal biological control that cells of an organism
 exert on each other.
 In order to improve our understanding, it is required to collect data about
 the different types, stages, and treatments of the disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This poses a problem: it is not possible to perform all of the assays required
 on the actual patients.
 There is just no justification for a patient to undergo surgery if we want
 to know if protein A interacts with protein B.
 Also, we can not try new treatments without a strong indication that this
 might be the best known possibility of curing a patient, as this would
 be highly unethical.
 It follows that there is a requirement for some biological system that
 mirrors the disease while, at the same time, is easy to handle in the laborator
y.
 In choosing such a system, the points mentioned involve a trade-off: one
 that mirrors the disease perfectly and is easy to handle does not exist,
 but there are multiple systems (outlined in the sections below) that are
 closer to one or the other.
 Which one to use must be decided in each experiment individually - considering
 its goals, effort, conclusiveness and applicability to the question studied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If these disease models provide a strong indication that a certain treatment
 approach is truly beneficial to a certain patient or patient group, this
 needs to be thoroughly tested to make sure that those indications previously
 shown using a model system - that are known to mirror a lot of aspects
 of the actual disease, but never all - actually hold in humans as well

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cell lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the easiest model systems that provide a reasonably accurate mirror
 of a lot of the biology involved in the disease are cell lines, which is
 basically taking a number of cells from a tumour, and growing them in a
 petri dish for multiple generations (passages).
 An advantage of this method is that the biological material that assays
 can be performed on is virtually unlimited, easy to produce and maintain.
 This is because cells grow in the dishes as long as they are supplied with
 nutrients and potentially growth factors or cytokines, while still reflecting
 a lot of the properties that cells in a tumour would.
 However, by passaging cells consecutively in petri dishes for many generations,
 the evolutionary pressure that they are selected by is essentially the
 growth rate on the dish, which will not reflect the forces one would find
 in a real tumour.
 In fact, the fastest growing clone will outcompete all others in a couple
 of generations - which gives a relatively uniform molecular phenotype across
 all cells, but in turn also loses the heterogeneity found in a primary
 sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, there is a multitude of cell lines available from commercial suppliers.
 The maybe best-known example is that of the HeLa cell line 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gey1952-qc"

\end_inset

 that was derived from a patient of cervical cancer in 1951, named Henrietta
 Lacks.
 This cell line, however, considering how long it has been kept in culture
 as well as its high mutation rate, has produced a genotype that no longer
 resembles primary cancer samples in many ways.
 One property is that a normal human cell has two copies of the genome (the
 two alleles), whereas HeLa cells have four copies, and its genome revealed
 more extensive aberrations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Landry2013-sk"

\end_inset

.
 In most cases however, experimentally used cell lines are more closely
 tied their origin: they have, albeit with aberrations, a genome that resembles
 primary tumours and they hence in many ways still resemble their tissue
 of origin in molecular terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are biological dynamics involved in a real tumour that can
 not be recapitulated by cell lines, like their interactions with other
 cells (especially immune cells) or with their surroundings (the extracellular
 matrix).
 Also, their number is limited.
 With the approximately 1,000 cell lines that the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity
 in Cancer (GDSC, cf.
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) screened for compound sensitivity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Iorio2016-gh"

\end_inset

, it is time to think about how many more cell lines would be needed to
 gain enough statistical power for the high number of rare mutations and
 whether the required amount of diversity can theoretically be generated
 with cell lines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Francies2015-fs"

\end_inset

.
 One way to resolve this issue could be organoid cultures: these are small
 assemblies of primary cells taken out of a tumour and grown in matrigel,
 where the spatial separation of mini-cultures retains much of the tumour
 heterogeneity

, for induced pluripotency), and mammals (mice, rats, and chimps; often
 for diseases).
 Just as the complexity of these organisms increases, they also mirror more
 closely aspects of human physiology.
 However, experiments performed in higher organisms also require more time,
 they are more difficult (and expensive) to set up, and there are ethical
 concerns on keeping, handling, and killing animals for the purpose of ultimatel
y saving human lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of cancer, looking at the number of articles published about a

One of the issues of both understanding as well as preventing or treating
 cancer development and progression is that it is a process with such complexity
 that a simple observation of patients with the disease will not suffice
 to come up with effective models of disease inception and progression,
 or treatments for that matter.
 Fortunately, we have got a battery of tests available, quantifying different
 molecular aspects of a biological sample.
 Examples of these data include the sequence, structure, and modification
 of DNA, but also the expression of RNA or proteins, including modifications.
 These different layers, able to quantify different projections of a cell's
 state, have provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to truly understand
 many molecular mechanisms that govern the processes active in both a normal
 and a diseased cell, and the differences between them.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All healthy cells contain roughly the same genome, yet the functions they
 perform in the body is vastly different.
 This is why in contrast to DNA, the RNA that is transcribed represents
 more the state a cell is currently in and functions that need to be performed
 at a given time and in a given context.
 It can hence be argued that the sum of RNAs (the transcriptome), or more
 specifically mRNAs provides an overview of the state a cell is currently
 in.
 Measuring those RNAs will allow us to get a picture of the processes going
 on in a cell at a given time.
 The two ways by which this is usually done are either microarrays or RNA
 sequencing, as outlined below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Microarrays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classic way to measure RNA expression is using microarrays 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brown1999-mc,Debouck1999-ec"

\end_inset

.
 These are, in the simplest case, a carrier matrix (glass can be used but
 the more recent chips use a polymer matrix) that has fixed single-stranded
 oligonucleotides spotted on them.
 From our sample, we would then extract and clean the RNA while simultaneously
 degrading any DNA that it contains, and label the RNA either with one dye
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gohlmann2009-ac,Du2008-sb"

\end_inset

 (if we want to quantify the expression levels of transcripts in a given
 sample) or two different dyes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shalon1996-pq"

\end_inset

 (if we want to quantify the difference between two samples).
 Such fluorescent dyes used are e.g.
 Cy3 and Cy5, that emit light in the green and red wave lengths upon stimulation
, respectively.
 Note that if the technical reproducibility of the platform is good enough,
 it is also possible to compare conditions by using two different arrays
 where we measure each sample individually and then compare the outcome.
 - A technique that has been favoured by companies like Affymetrix as it
 allowed chips at much higher density and the comparison between each sample
 in a control- and in a experimental condition, as well as between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious drawback of this technology is that we need to know in advance
 which oligonucleotides to spot, so in turn which genes we are looking for.
 There needs to be different chips for different organisms, depending on
 the gene sequences that they carry.
 This selection of genes that we look at can of course introduce bias, in
 such that we can't look for transcripts that we don't know exist, but also
 we might focus on transcripts and isoforms that we think are important
 before carrying out an experiment.
 Another possible issue is their detection threshold.
 As the readout is fluorescence based and there will always be a base-line
 level of it, and it is hard to quantify the amount of RNA bound on a spot
 of the total number of molecules are so low that a few molecules do not
 significantly change the readout.
 Turning this argument around, RNA binding to spots also has its point of
 saturation, where it does not matter if there is more RNA present or not
 once all probes bind to their complementary sequence and thus produce a
 signal

RNA sequencing

An alternative approach that has become more popular recently with the falling
 costs of DNA sequencing is to apply this technology to RNA as well 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Marioni2008-lb,Wang2009-ge"

\end_inset

.
 In this case, we can use the RNA that we isolated from a sample, reverse-transc
ribe it into DNA, and sequence the DNA like we would normally.
 This has got the advantage that it can be used even if there is no genome
 sequence or chip available and as a consequence we are also not biasing
 our selection of genes by previously knowing what to look at 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Trapnell2010-le"

\end_inset

, with the exception of sections in the RNA that can be more or easily transcrib
ed into DNA (like GC-rich regions that also pose challenges for sequencing).
 Another advantage is that the dynamic range of this technology (

\end_inset

, the differences in transcript numbers it can detect) is much higher than
 it is for microarrays, both on the lower as well as on the upper bound:
 we can detect a single read, but also having a lot of reads won't saturate
 our signal the same way that spots on the microarray do (although if a
 large proportion of the reads is from a highly abundant molecule, this
 will decrease sensitivity for detecting other RNAs).

\begin_layout Standard
The way RNA-seq quantification

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The transcription level of a gene, transcript or exon are then quantified
 by how many reads align to the corresponding section in the genome.

 to get around performing the alignment step by k-mer counting and so-called
 pseudo-alignments.

\begin_layout Standard
It can easily be argued that in order to get an appropriate picture of what
 goes on in a cell it would be better to look at the proteins that perform
 most functions, as opposed to the mRNA levels of genes.
 The latter will in many cases be translated into proteins that then exert
 their activity, yet mRNA measurements are one more step removed from the
 functional process than proteins, and measuring post-translational modification
s (PTMs) that modify activity already gives us a lot of functional information
 - as long as we know how to interpret it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking these facts together, we might want to look at proteins instead of
 gene expression.
 Yet, gene expression is a lot cheaper and easier to measure, as well as
 providing more coverage than the proteomic methods currently can.
 Also, the publicly available gene expression data far exceeds the one of
 proteomic data.
 There are different experimental methods for quantifying proteins and their
 state, the most well-known are listed below.

 is based on fragmenting proteins into peptides that are then ionized and
 sprayed into an electrical field in a vacuum tube, where their mass-to-charge
 ratio causes them to behave in a certain way.
 For instance, in Time of Flight (

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Over the last decades and years, biology moved from an observational, qualitativ
e science to a very much quantitative one.
 This can largely be attributed to high throughput assays, led by the advance
 of DNA sequencing and followed by its derivatives as well as other approaches,
 like high-content phenotypic screening - each allowing for measuring not
 one data point, but hundreds and sometimes thousands at a time.
 The magic component in this process is automation: the bulk of the data
 generated by scientific laboratories are not longer carried out by individual
 scientists pipetting together reagents, but by machines controlled by computers
 and designed by both scientists and industry alike.
 This shift of paradigm has not only produced much more data, but arguably
 led to an increase in the quality of such data as well, by removing the
 human element (mood, ability to concentrate, etc.) from large parts of the
 outcome of an experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This transformation has not only come with its benefits, but also with its
 challenges.
 Setting aside the view of some prominent scientists that each experiment
 needs to have a specific question or hypothesis in mind and that generating
 data first and using the data itself as a hypothesis generator is an inferior
 approach (as best demonstrated by Sidney Brenner's quote 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

low input, high throughput, not output
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

), a biomedical scientist's skill requirements have moved from knowing,
 for instance, as many details about a given gene as possible to understanding
 how to set up reproducible assays, generate reliable data, but especially
 treating the resulting data in a way that yields biological insights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two crucial parts to this: one is algorithms, that transform the
 raw data generated by a given experiment into biologically interpretable
 indications, and the second is statistics, to make sure the effect observed
 is due to the data and not due to random chance while analysing the results.
 I will outline some very successful ideas that in turn led to algorithms
 and usable software packages for investigating molecular data, both in
 terms of cancer as well as in general, in the sections of this and the
 next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, let us first reconsider the goal we are trying to achieve in terms
 of this thesis as well as a lot of the related work: we ultimately want
 to improve how cancer is diagnosed and treated for patients, and those
 algorithms help us to define markers of their pathogenesis or how they
 could reap benefits from being offered a particular treatment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We thus want to transform the numbers reflecting the molecular data we
 have in a meaningful way so they connect to this endeavour.

\begin_layout Subsection
Patterns of mutations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When looking at sets of mutations instead of individual ones distinct patterns
 emerge.
 One such pattern is that there are modules that are either co-occurring
 or mutually exclusive 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Babur2015-ap"

\end_inset

.
 In the event of co-occurring mutations, this might mean that a given mutation
 is not sufficient to obtain a certain trait and thus a second mutation
 is necessary to confer it.
 In the case of mutual exclusivity, a second mutation is not conferring
 a growth advantage after the first one arose.
 This may be due to evolutionary parsimony or a fitness defect.
 In the first case, a second mutation that inactivates, for example, an
 already inactivated tumour suppressor pathway is unlikely to happen on
 the population-level because there is no selective pressure, as the required
 trait has already been acquired by the cell.
 In the second case, the growth advantage conferred by one mutation might
 be cancelled out or counteracted by the presence of a second one, thereby
 mediating a selection growth disadvantage (fitness defect) of the cells
 carrying both mutations as opposed to either one of them.
\end_layout

 types that, combined with oncogene addiction

 forms the basis of many targeted therapies: if you can inhibit signalling
 stemming from a mutation that drives a cancer's development and progression,
 the affected cells' growth will be severely abrogated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept that a second mutation kills a cell with a given mutation has
 been termed synthetic lethality.
 It has been used to study genetic interactions in model organisms for a
 long time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nijman2011-zf"

\end_inset

.
 The loss of both genes in a synthetic lethal pair is, as the name suggests,
 lethal to the organism, but the loss of each individual gene is not.
 More recently, these interactions have been used to identify probes interfering
 with RNA that are purified from a starting population 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cheung2011-be"

\end_inset

 and efficient computational algorithms have been developed to find those
 pairs in primary cancer data sets like the TCGA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ciriello2012-hc,Gobbi2014-xz"

\end_inset

.
 These interactions can then be transformed in a network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jerby-Arnon2014-fn"

\end_inset

, which can then be used to predict sensitivity of cancer cell lines to
 a certain drug treatment, as well as clinical outcome given the level of
 co-expression of its pairs.

Gene expression clustering

Cancer is known to be a heterogeneous disease, with individual tumours forming
 different subtypes even if it arose from the same tissue.
 One of the arguably most effective ways of elucidating the state of individual
 tumours and cell populations therein is quantifying its using methods such
 as microarrays or RNA sequencing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use the global pattern of gene expression to identify different subtypes
 of the disease in a given tissue (or even between tissues).
 A challenge with this is is that the transcriptome could be comprised of
 up to 22,000 genes without even considering most regulatory or ribosomal

 This space needs to be reduced to something more manageable for inspection,
 which may reveal subgroups that have prognostic or therapeutic relevance.

 set are called dimensionality reduction techniques, while methods assigning
 the different samples to different subtypes are called clustering algorithms

 back into

 It starts with assigning N cluster centres randomly in a given data set,
 and then assigning all samples that have a smaller distance to a given

 These assignments are iterative, which means that once the cluster centres
 have been determined and the samples assigned, the centres are updated
 to correspond to the centre of the samples each cluster is associated with.
 In turn, which samples are associated with which clusters is also updated

 Then we could use the downstream genes that are changing as a signature

 This has got two applications that have indeed been used, which are: (1)
 matching a drug's signature with another drug's signature, and if they
 are a close match but have e.g.
 different indications, suggest that each drug may be used for the other
 indication (where directionality may be limited by additional factors),
 or (2) matching a drug's signature with the inverse gene expression changes
 that a disease exhibits over normal controls, we can suggest that this
 drug may be used to counteract the effects of the disease

 be a potential treatment if the disease is indeed caused by the gene expression
 changes that the drug reverses.
 However, those matches should rather be seen as hypothesis generators than
 definite indications for repurposing and treatment.
 Of course, this kind of approach relies on the availability of signatures
 of the drugs we look at, or of a given drug and disease, respectively.

Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important consequence of the central dogma is that gene expression patterns
 are not randomly but hierarchically organised.
 Starting with perturbations on a cell's surface or its interior, a signal
 is propagated from its origin up to proteins that bind to DNA and change
 their expression as a response to the stimulus.
 The terminal nodes of this signal transduction are called transcription
 factors, that upon binding on the DNA mediate and direct (either in a promoting
 or in an inhibiting fashion) binding of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) that forms a complex with available factors in order to start transcription
 of a factor's target genes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Watson1987-mw"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The genes transcribed upon activation of transcription factors may in turn
 be transcription factors themselves that cause increased or decreased transcrip
tion of other genes.
 These interactions between different transcription factors are usually
 referred to as a transcription factor network or gene regulatory network
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bansal2007-rb"

\end_inset

.
 There are multiple ways these can be investigated: by characterising which
 transcription factors bind to which genes (either experimentally or computation
ally by looking at which sequence of nucleotides a given factor is likely
 to bind), by finding genes that change in a coordinated fashion and hypothesise
 that those might be regulated by the same set of factors, or by inferring
 which combination of which factors is required for a certain gene to be
 transcribed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pathways and signalling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cell signalling is deregulated in many diseases, including cancer that I
 focus on here because of the sheer wealth of available data.
 But how to best quantify the signalling activity? The closest proxy we
 have would be to quantify post-translational modifications that are known
 to confer activity.
 In the simplest case this could be a phosphate group on a certain position
 that is known to make a kinase active, that is that it in turn phosphorylates
 its downstream targets.
 But phosphorylation data, and to a lesser extent protein data in general
 is much harder to come by than sequencing data.
 Mass spectrometry and Reverse Phase Protein Arrays just do not produce
 the same clarity that a DNA sequence or RNA level provides, plus is much
 harder to generate because the technology that could do it with the same
 throughput as sequencing technologies just does not exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can thus argue that computational methods are required to make statements
 about cell signalling, starting from DNA and RNA instead of protein and

 data.
 The simplest approach to this is looking how much mRNA of signalling molecules
 are expressed that comprise a pathway, and designate a high expression
 a high activity and vice versa (using algorithms like Gene Set Enrichment
 Analysis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This, however, is at odds with the way cell signalling works and is regulated.

Binding motifs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some, albeit not all, transcription factors prefer to bind a specific sequence
 of nucleotides that they recognize on the DNA strands, called a motif.
 Starting from binding data such as

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 peaks, they can be found using tools such as

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that will report different weight matrices for nucleotides around the binding
 region (which correspond to how often a given nucleotide is found in a
 given position).
 These motifs in turn can be used to scan the genome for the same or a similar
 sequence using a sliding window approach that may indicate sites where
 a transcription factor could bind but did not in the original experiment.
 Such can for instance be the case if the chromatin is too densely packed
 in a region (but may not be if the cell was in a different state or from
 a different tissue), or the binding site is occupied by another transcription
 factor blocking the binding of the one we are looking at.
 There are databases that collect and store those motifs from experimental
 data and their known and predicted binding in different cell types, such

Mutual Information for transcription factor networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another question that we might be interested in is which genes share a common
 regulator.
 In the simplest case this is a transcription factor that, upon activation,
 transcribes a set of genes in a coordinated fashion.
 Thus, we can look for genes that are expressed in a coordinated fashion
 across different conditions by calculating the mutual information of all
 gene pairs and setting a lower bound to consider.
 Further, we can prune the edges in the resulting network by postulating
 that a link between genes 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is indirect if the mutual information of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 The idea here is to look at the upper and lower third of the modulator
 expression, and calculate mutual information for both of these sets.
 Afterwards, instead of inferring the network, the authors look for the
 strongest changes in mutual information between the two subsets: if that
 is the case, the modulator can be seen as a co-factor required for transcriptio
n factor regulation.
 If a high modulator expression correlates with an increase of mutual informatio
n it will likely be activating, or inactivating in case of a decrease.

 publishing new results quickly instead of thoroughly and over-claiming
 the effect or significance of a study in order to have an article accepted
 in the top tier journals.

It is easy to argue that experimental reproducibility is a hard issue to
 tackle, as the potential for confounding variables is huge and a lab will
 hardly ever have the resources to account for all of them.
 In general, good study design, that is proper controls and randomisation,
 should go a long way (especially in the case of clinical trials), but even
 then, there may be confounding effects unknown to the experimenters that
 can not properly be controlled for, as has later been shown in the case
 where male vs.
 female stewards in a mouse facility produced different reactions of the
 animals, potentially influencing the results obtained from a very large
 number of studies

Apart from experimental reproducibility, computational reproducibility should
 be an issue that is easier to tackle, because at least for deterministic
 algorithms the same input should always produce the same output using the
 same tools.
 However, this is also easier said than done because the tools will depend
 on other tools, maybe with different versions, and each version may change
 the way they treat the data to go from input to output in a slightly different
 way.
 This is especially true as computational analyses, as well as the tools
 employed, are getting more and more complex.
 However, even if the potential confounding factors are smaller than for
 experimental scientists, computational analysis also has its high-profile
 cases fraught with issues.
 The most well-known example of this are maybe Anil Potti's cancer gene
 signatures

To summarise, ensuring that a subsequent study has the possibility to arrive
 at the same conclusions given the same starting point, and in turn build
 on the results in a more confident way, has gotten a big enough issue to
 dedicate an introductory chapter to it.
 Since I did not perform any experiments to produce data myself, the focus
 of this chapter shall be to ensure that the results obtained by transforming
 raw (or in some cases already processed) data into other types of data,
 plots, and ultimately interpretation are reproducible in a sense that a
 person not involved in the projects could arrive at the same conclusion,
 being provided this thesis, the code used, and the technical documentation
 written in conjunction with it.
 This is especially true because the maybe best known retraction caused
 by computational irreproducibility handled a topic very similar to the
 one I investigate in this thesis: the effect of signalling pathway signatures
 of different cancers (chapter 3) and their significance (chapter 4).

Scientific software ecosystem

\begin_layout Standard
With computational analyses getting more complex, it is no longer enough
 to just apply a simple statistical test for a number of observations of
 one condition vs.
 another.
 The wealth of data that has become available needs pre-processing, normalising,
 statistical analysis, and interpretation of results.
 No one scientist can perform all of these tasks completely independently,
 as some of them may detailed knowledge of all the algorithms involved,
 up to an extent that is prohibitory.
 It is thus required to package repeated steps together in higher-order
 functionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where the scientific software ecosystem comes in.
 And, to a larger extent, the ecosystem of general software.
 For instance, I want to obtain, pre-process, and normalise microarray data
 to then compute differentially expressed genes in two conditions.
 The concepts of obtain, pre-process, and normalise are well enough defined
 that I should not have to worry about their exact implementation.
 I just need to know what these concepts mean and that there is a software
 that abstracts the low-level implementation to a higher-level function
 that I can just apply.
 And, in addition, I want to script those steps together without needing
 to worry about things like the exact memory allocation in each step.

A challenge that often is underestimated is that even when all of the code
 that was used in order to generate the result is provided, it is often
 not trivial know which script generates which part of the analysis, and
 which other scripts, analyses, or data it depends on.
 Hence it is not only important to provide the code as it is, but also informati
on on how to run it, so to not only have all the bits and pieces but a way
 to connect them to a workflow from the data to the results.

One of the major challenges is how to use the available molecular data in
 an efficient and reproducible manner.
 While this is relatively straightforward for mutational data (mostly used
 as binary features), it gets much more challenging for higher content readouts
 like gene expression or DNA methylation.
 Specifically, expression-derived biomarkers that were able to separate
 distinct populations in a given set of conditions have often failed to
 replicate their function once the conditions are altered.
 As DNA methylation is dynamic, it will likely offer the same challenges.
 Still, there is a tremendous amount of information that can and should
 be used to decide on the optimal treatment of patients, but most approaches
 have fallen short of that promise.

One way gene expression has shown promise is using global clustering to
 identify subtypes of the disease, and associating those with different
 drug response or survival outcome.
 I believe that stratifying patients in a reproducible manner should involve
 both the overall clustering of the data as well as more specific, functionally
 relevant readouts.
 An example of those functional readouts is the expression level of pre-defined
 pathway sets - mostly using the

 To date, it is largely unexplored how much those pathway-expression-based

 protein network.
 This is why I later followed different strategy: use a large body of publicly

 to a specified set of stimuli, and then use those genes to infer the upstream
