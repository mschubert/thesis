Functional Evaluation of Pathway Methods in basal Gene Expression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter represents the evaluation of the model proposed in the previous
 one.
 It aims to investigate the functional relevance of pathway-responsive genes
 (PRGs) compared to other pathway methods.
 In terms of outcomes, I am interested in how well the available platform
 is able to explain:

A linear model is easily transferable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I am most interested in how basal signalling activity in cancer cell
 lines and tumour samples correlates with outcomes such as drug response
 and survival, one crucial point of deriving pathway response signatures
 is that they also need to reflect pathway activation in basal gene expression.
 At this point, I know that my perturbation-response signature genes correspond
 to the pathway activation between a basal and perturbed condition, but
 not how well the pattern of pathway activation from those perturbation
 experiments corresponds to gene expression footprints of a constitutively
 active signalling pathway leaves in basal gene expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Providing a definitive proof that the same signatures obtained correspond
 to constitutive activation in basal expression is only possible using a
 range of functional readouts,

\begin_layout Standard
What I can more easily show, however, is how well known pathway cross-talk
 and structure (as is known in literature and I have shown in figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Modelled-pathway-crosstalk"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sp2-exp-heatmap"

\end_inset

) translates to pathway correlation in basal expression, and how well they
 agree between tumours and cell lines.
 To this end, I computed pathway scores for all primary tumours in the TCGA
 and cell lines in the GDSC (details section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Correlation-in-basal"

\end_inset

), and checked how well they correlate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find that not only are the correlations in basal gene expression (figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Correlation-speed"

\end_inset

) similar to the ones in perturbed experiments (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sp2-exp-heatmap"

\end_inset

), but they also correlate very well with known cross-talk and do not change
 more than could be biologically expected between primary tumours and cell
 lines.
 I find a high correlation between EGFR and MAPK and a lesser one to PI3K,
 as well as TNFa and NFkB.
 Another high correlation is between NFkB and JAK-STAT that I also observed
 in perturbation experiments (below cutoff of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sp2-exp-heatmap"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dependence on input experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point I found strong indications that the gene expression changes
 in perturbation experiments can be described across many conditions using
 a linear consensus signature whose score reflects pathway activation and
 this signature is translatable to basal pathway activity in non-perturbed
 gene expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I have not shown yet is how stable the whole process is, i.e.
 much the selection of input experiments influences the scores in basal
 expression.
 In order to investigate this, I bootstrapped the experiment selection 1,000
 times and built models as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Building-the-Model"

\end_inset

, using the GDSC basal expression and yielding a 3-dimensional scores tensor
 with a score for each cell line, pathway, and bootstrap.
 I regressed out either the effect of the individual cell lines or the effect
 of the bootstraps, and quantified the relative remaining variance in the
 scores:

Stability of basal pathway scores when bootstrapping input experiments
\end_layout

\end_inset

Stability of basal pathway scores when bootstrapping input experiments.
 The variance of pathway scores in cell lines given bootstraps is more than
 five times as high compared to the variance of bootstraps given cell lines
 for all pathways except two (Trail and VEGF), where it is roughly twice
 as high.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overview of those relative variances is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bootstraps-basal"

\end_inset

.
 Here, a value smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 indicates that the experiment selection has a bigger effect than the cell
 line I apply the model to (i.e., we can not observe a biological effect because
 it is hidden by the noise of input experiments) and values bigger than
 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 indicate the times the biological context is more influential for providing
 the score than the input selection (i.e, the biological context outweighs
 the exact selection of perturbation input).
 For most pathways (TNFa, NFkB, MAPK, JAK-STAT, Hypoxia, and EGFR) the variance
 of the input experiments was only a negligible influence (smaller than
 10%) on the final scores.
 For p53, TGFb, and PI3K selection of the input experiments still accounts
 for under 20% of the observed variance of basal pathway scores.
 For Trail and VEGF, it is about twice as large as the variance of the input
 experiments.
 This can either point to the pathway not being particularly well defined
 (if the experiments are also not well recovered by the signature, like
 for VEGF in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ROC"

\end_inset

), or that the overall number of input experiments is too small to guarantee
 a stable signature (like for Trail, where the signature performs well but
 the overall number of experiments are low, cf.
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ROC"

) for each TCGA study separately.
 The result of this transformation are expression values that I can use
 linear modelling techniques on, unlike the raw RNA-seq read counts.
 With the resulting expression matrix, I selected only genes that had an
 HGNC symbol associated with them.
 I used the function

 This resulted in one expression matrix per TCGA tissue, for a total of
 34 tissues including 9179 tumour and 661 matched normal samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I computed the pathway scores for perturbation-response genes as well as
 all other method using the subset of tissues in the TCGA gene expression
 data that had 30 or more normals in the same tissue (TCGA identifier

 This is to make full use of the advanced pathway methods (figure

 For the cell lines in the GDSC, I do not have tissue-matched normals, so
 this is not possible and I calculate the scores for the cell lines alone
 or comparing one cell line to the rest of the tissue if the method requires
 it (SPIA and Pathifier).

 Gene Ontology (bottom) is very similar to Reactome.
 For both methods, the correlation between pathways is similar from primary

) and the gene set methods (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:basal-comparison-methods"

\end_inset

), SPIA and Pathifier had more data available to compute their scores for
 the TCGA cohorts because they made use of the tissue-matched normals.
 This has a minor impact on the correlation between pathway scores obtained
 by SPIA (both show a high correlation between MAPK, NFkB, and Trail, top
 panel), but a major impact on the ones obtained by Pathifier (middle):
 here, supplying normals cause all the pathway scores to be highly correlated,
 while there is almost no correlation to be observed for the cell lines.
 For PARADIGM (bottom), there is almost no correlation between the nodes
 in the inference graph that correspond to pathway activity.

Pathway scores and mutations/CNAs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I computed pathway scores for TCGA cohorts where there were tissue-matched
 normals available.
 For mutated genes, I considered all genes that had a change of coding sequence
 (SNP, small indels in MAF files) as mutated and all others as not mutated.
 For copy number alterations, I used the thresholded GISTIC scores, where
 we considered homozygous deletions (
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

) and strong amplifications (
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

) as altered, no change (
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

) as basal and discarded intermediate values (
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

) from my analysis.
 I focussed on the subset of 464 driver genes that were also used in the
 GDSC.
 I used the sets of mutations and CNAs to compute the linear associations
 between samples for all different methods I looked at.
 I did not regress out the cancer type in order to keep associations where
 mutations/CNAs are highly correlated with it, but highlighted all associations
 that passed the significance threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $FDR<0.05$
\end_inset

 (for each pathway method individually) after such a correction.

If my reasoning is correct and pathway-response signatures indeed correspond
 to intrinsic signalling activity, I should be able to see a higher pathway
 score in cancer patients with an oncogenic driver mutation and a lower
 score when a tumour suppressor is mutated or lost compared to patients
 where no such alteration is present.
 Depending on how those aberrations are spread across cancer types, I should
 be able to detect them within or across cancer types.

I selected all cancer types in the TCGA for which there were tissue-matched
 normals available, in order to make full use of the pathway methods that
 require them.
 I calculated pathway scores for those using pathway-response genes, Reactome

While this will also remove genuine differences in pathway activation between
 different cancer types, I would not be able to distinguish between those
 and other confounders that impact the sensitivity of a certain cell line
 from a given tissue to a drug.
 My pan-cancer association are thus correcting for different tissues when
 computing differences in drug response explained by inferred (our method,

 For tissue-specific associations, I fit the linear model and correct p-values

I found that for the pan-cancer setting, there were 199 significant associations
 (FDR<10%, conditioned on tissue of origin) for my method and 27 and 66
 for Gene Ontology and Reactome pathways, respectively.
 The top hit using my method was the associations between Nutlin-3a and
 p53-responsive genes.
 Nutlin-3a is an MDM2-inhibitor that in turn stabilizes p53, where it has
 also previously been shown that a mutation in

I performed drug associations also on the tissue-specific level.
 However, by dividing my dataset into the different cancer types I lose
 statistical power, so I chose in the first instance to only look at the
 subset of clinically approved drugs for the already stratified populations.

\begin_layout Standard
A drug association analysis for each tissue separately (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The strongest association was response to the MEK inhibitor Trametinib
 where sensitivity was positively correlated with expression of MAPK-responsive
 genes, explaining a total of 54% of the total variance observed in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $IC_{50}$

s of BRCA drug response (
\begin_inset Formula $p<10^{-8}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $FDR<10^{-5}$
\end_inset

).
 My method is the only one able to recover this association, which is expected
 due to oncogene addiction to a hyper-activated MAPK pathway, or any other
 associations involving EGFR/MAPK for BRCA.

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps more interestingly, I found two associations to drugs with strong
 effect sizes.
 The inferred activity of Trail correlates with increased sensitivity to
 Docetaxel in Low-Grade Glioma (LGG), where an increased response to Docetaxel
 (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

) in combination with a Bcl-2 inhibitor has been previously shown in BRCA
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Also, EGFR activity correlates with increased resistance in Esophageal
 Carcinoma (ESCA) cell lines treated with Rapamycin (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:strat-LGG"

\end_inset

).
 While BRCA and ESCA are already more sensitive to these drugs than most
 other tissues (unlike the case above of BRCA for Trametinib), the additional
 stratification by pathway scores identifies a subset comprised of half
 the cell lines per tissue with a more sensitive median response compared
 to all tissues, including those where the drug is in clinical use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Patient survival using the TCGA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implications of inferred pathway activity compared to pathway expression
 is expected to be less clear for patient survival than for cell line drug
 response due to more heterogeneity and many more confounding factors involved
 that affect the phenotype observed.
 Nonetheless, I was interested in how my inferred pathway activity compared
 to the pathway expression methods in terms of overall patient survival.
 I would expect activity of canonical oncogenic pathways to be negatively
 correlated with patient survival and pro-apoptotic pathways to be positively
 correlated.

 Proportional Hazard model (R package

 For the pan-cancer cohort, I regressed out the effect of the study and
 age of the patient, and fitted the model for each pathway and method used.
 For the tissue-specific cohorts, I regressed out the age of the patients.
 I adjusted the p-values using the FDR for each method and for each method
 and study separately.
 I selected a significance threshold of 5 and 10% for the pan-cancer and
 cancer-specific associations respectively.

Comparison of pathway methods by association of a pathway with increased
 (green) or decreased (red) patient survival.
 Colours correspond to z-score (grey: FDR>20%, white: no pathway available).
 Method (vertical) and pathway (horizontal) labels as indicated.
 For our method, MAPK/EGFR provide the strongest negative contribution to
 survival.
 Trail/apoptosis is the only pathway mediating prolonged survival, but missing
 the significance threshold.

 Gene Ontology found much weaker associations for those pathways, and the
 other methods missed them almost entirely.
 In terms of Trail activity, PRGs find an increase in survival while the
 other methods show either a decrease or no effect.
 For JAK-STAT, NFkB, p53, and VEGF there are no significant associations
 that are picked up by more than one method (

 Compared to pathway scores, driver mutations only showed a significant

\begin_layout Standard
For Kaplan-Meier survival curves (figure

\end_inset

) it is only straightforward to plot discrete classes of input and not the
 continuous pathway scores I obtained using the different methods.
 In order to get distinct classes needed for interpretable survival curves,
 I split all obtained pathway scores in upper, the two middle, and lower
 quartile and respectively assigned the classes “up”, “unknown”, and “down”
 to show for the three examples of associations found.

\begin_layout Standard
As already found with the tissue-specific associations, Kidney Renal Clear
 Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) and Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) show decreased survival
 with TNFa and the latter with JAK-STAT, pathways where activating mutations
 are much less well established than for EGFR/MAPK.
\end_layout

For these associations, I found a difference in one-year survival of over
 25% between the top and bottom quartiles of the assigned pathway scores
 (figure

 Compared to mutations, PRG associations were stronger (FDR

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functional context in terms of cancer hallmarks that mutations create
 are similar despite obvious differences in the exact mode, as exemplified
 by the long tail of different variants seen in cancer genomes.
 For cancer diagnosis in both the clinical and preclinical setting, efforts
 like The Cancer Genome Atlas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas_Research_Network2013-bi"

\end_inset

 or the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have pioneered this
 characterization on a large scale, offering the opportunity to derive large
 amounts of information about individual tumours and in turn likely harbours
 yet undiscovered treatment opportunities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the recent focus on linking outcomes with mutations represents a step
 forward over basing treatment of an individual on the tissue of tumour
 origin alone, putting mutations in a functional context with the signalling
 aberrations that they create may provide additional insight in mechanisms
 of pathogenesis and treatment opportunities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of drug associations, I have shown that my method outperforms the
 associations obtained by using GSEA on either pathway expression or GO
 modules, that strong tissue-specific associations are able to explain a
 significant part of the overall variability in the response to some drugs,
 and that pathway associations can be used to refine mutational biomarkers,
 or act as biomarkers themselves when there is no known associated mutation
 for a given drug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I expect that this method of deriving signatures for pathway activity will
 also in other contexts be able to discover both oncogene addiction footprints
 to support available mutational biomarkers, as well as provide insights
 into pathway activation patterns that mediate sensitivity or resistance
 to a subset of drugs that other pathway-expression based methods are not
 able to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For survival associations, only my signatures find the pathways that we
 would most expect to decrease patient survival by accelerating tumour growth
 (EGFR and MAPK) and promoting survival by apoptosis (Trail) to be associated
 with the respective outcome in both the pan-cancer and the tissue-specific
 cohorts.
 Other methods fail to separate those, only obtain significant associations
 for a very limited number of cancer types, and show high correlation between
 pathways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, my results suggest that consensus pathway response signatures provide
 a better measure of pathway activity than pathway expression, irrespective
 of whether the latter was derived from gene sets or directed paths.
 I have shown that they are able to refine our understanding of the impact
 of mutations, as well as their utility for cell line drug response and
 patient survival.
 The examples I outlined show that a downstream readout should be used as
 a proxy for pathway activity instead of mapping mRNA expression levels
 to signalling molecules.
