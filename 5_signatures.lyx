Aim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe the simplest way to investigate a biological system using gene expression
 data is to not make any assumptions concerning translation, protein activity,
 signaling, or pathways.
 Instead, one could use the transcriptional state of a cell as a black box
 entirely and just treat it as a readout of its phenotype.
 This has the advantage that many of the assumptions that we normally make
 that are not quite correct (mRNA expression corresponds to protein level
 or activity, exactly those genes in a set have that function and there
 is no overlap or partial membership, etc.) no longer have an impact on the
 result we obtain - we can just use the gene expression readout of a disease,
 a drug treatment, or really anything else that produces gene expression
 changes and match them to another phenotype (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Iorio2013-pv"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this Signature Matching approach, there are, as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Signature-Matching-Approaches"

\end_inset

, two commonly used workflows: First, we can define the signature of a disease
 (e.g.
 from cancer-normal pairs) and then look for a drug signature to counteract
 this phenotype.
 This may work well in certain circumstances, but is undoubtedly a gross
 oversimplification of the problem of disease inception and progression.
 Nontheless, it has been shown to work ***refs***, and our group has previously
 worked on an R package for matching drugs and diseases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pacini2013-xn"

\end_inset

.
 Second, we can take a drug signature and match it to other drug signatures,
 to maybe discover a new indication for a drug and repurposing opportunities
 more generally.
 Also in our group, this has been done to discover a drug mode of action
 (MoA)

\begin_layout Standard
At the time I started this project, the LINCS Connectivity Map data had
 just been released.
 The BROAD institute held a small symposium and workshop about the platform
 (the L1000), the data they had collected, and how they are planning to
 take it forward with web-based 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

apps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that did signature matching based on GSEA without actually exposing the
 data to its users.
 They did, however, release the raw data and z-scores between each control-
 and drug-perturbed experiment for 978 oligonucleotide probes and a total
 of 1.4 million conditions in a 111 gigabyte .gctx (HDF5 and metadata) file
 where they projected their actual measurement to the full gene space using
 publicly available microarray data.
 At this time, no one knew about the quality of the data (BROAD claimed
 it to be equal with microarrays; my own tries and conversations with other
 people using the data have indicated that it is below that).
 The main publication is still not out today (April 2016), and they refused
 to share e.g.
 the linear transformation matrix they used to obtain the projected gene
 space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notwithstanding those potential issues, it would be of enormous interest
 to combine this data set with what we are already working on with the GDSC:
 this way, we have for the same cancer tissue (sometimes even the same cell
 line) not only high-quality baseline expression and drug response curves,
 but also lower coverage/quality drug-perturbed gene for a lot of different
 compounds, including 150 drug that are overlapping between the GDSC and
 the LINCS project, for which we could use Signature Matching methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more interesting, we could generate a signature between cells that
 are sensitive and those that are resitant to a certain kind of drug, and
 then match this signature with another drug that potentially converts the
 cells from a resitant to a sensitive phenotype.
 This has been shown to work when trying to overcome glutocorticoid resistance
 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wei2006-ne"

\end_inset

, where the authors identified Rapamycin as a modulator of the resistance
 phenotype.
 But now, we could do it systematically with the 150x150 drugs overlapping
 between the LINCS and GDSC projects, and could thus obtain the first view
 of drug sensitisation over a large target space.
 This could ultimately lead to a new drug combination or regimen that counters
 the development of resistance in clinical cancer patients, which is one
 of the main challenges in patient treatment today.

We fit a model to Z-scores of each perturbation experiment.

 Negative correlation between cell lines expressing the signature and observed
 IC50s implies a good combination.
 This has more power than GSEA in our analyses.

Fitting Drug Response Curves

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we know which concentration 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 of a given drug we treat our cells with and which relative viability 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 we observe, we can calculate the Hill parameters for the minimal viability
 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{min}$
\end_inset

, the maximal viability 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{max}$
\end_inset

, the concentration of the half maximum effect 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and the slope of the sigmoid 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{min}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{max}$
\end_inset

 are usually for the minimum and maximum effect instead of relative viability.
 We can use them for viability here because both range between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, the only difference is that our curve is that in this case we are modeling
 a sigmoid decrease instead of increase, so the only different is that the
 slope parameter has a different sign.
 The relationship 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 between our drug response paramters is in both cases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=m\left(\frac{y-E^{min}}{E^{max}-y}\right)^{-\lambda}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given enough data points we can calculate the best fit using nonlinear least
 squares for our parameters.
 I make an additional assumption here, which is that a drug that is infinitely
 diluted will show no inhibition of cell growth (or full viability) by setting
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{max}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 instead of optimising it between

 To calculate our expected response 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{Loewe}$
\end_inset

 given treatment with two drugs at concentration 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$

 numerically [yadav2015complex].
\end_layout

\]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way I do this is to use the bisect function of SciPy between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-10^{5}$
\end_inset

, where the the returned value of the function is smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 for the input close to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 for the input 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 Having those two different signs, the solver divides the interval between
 the two input values iteratively until it reaches a value for 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{Loewe}$
\end_inset

that makes the function approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 up to a default tolerance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I calculate the expected viability 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{Loewe}$
\end_inset

for the whole matrix of same drug concentration as was used in the combination
 screening.
 This way, I get a drug response surface that corresponds to a drug interaction
 that is neither synergistic nor antagonistic.
 The volume between the calculated and measured surface then corresponds
 to an observed interaction effect: If we see fewer cells survive than we
 would expect under the assumption of an additive effect we found a synergistic
 combination, or an antagonistic one if vice versa.

\begin_layout Standard
